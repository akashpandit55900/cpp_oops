/*
    âœ… What is a Structure?
    A struct is a user-defined data type in C++ that groups different types of variables under one name.
    
    struct StructureName {
        dataType member1;
        dataType member2;
        ...
    };

    âœ… Key Points:
    - All members occupy separate memory.
    - You can access members using the dot (.) operator.
    - Structures can contain functions, too (in C++ only, not C).
    - always use primitive data types here for simplicity

    ðŸ§  When to Use:
    - Use struct when you want to store all values simultaneously.
    - Use union when you want to store only one value at a time, and want to save memory.
