*OOPS* => Object-Oriented Programming System
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

*Key Concepts of OOP*

1) *Class*: A blueprint for creating objects (a combination of variables and functions)(contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods)).

2) *Object*: An instance of a class.

3) *Encapsulation*: Bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Access is controlled using access specifiers *(public, private, protected)*.

4) *Abstraction*: Hiding the complex details of the system and showing only the necessary functionality to the user.

5) *Inheritance*: A mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behavior of another class.

6) *Polymorphism*: The ability of a function or method to behave differently based on the object calling it.
